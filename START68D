## 📝 Problem Statement (Short Summary)

Chef buys a stock at price `x` and sells it at price `y`.  
You need to determine whether Chef made a **PROFIT**, a **LOSS**, or if it was a **NEUTRAL** trade (no profit or loss).

## ✅ My Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int t,x,y;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while(t--)
    {
        scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
        if(x-y<0)
        {
            printf("PROFIT\n");
        }
        if(x-y==0)
        {
            printf("NEUTRAL\n");
        }
        if(x-y>0)
        {
            printf("LOSS\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
}


💡 Explanation
First, we read the number of test cases t.

For each test case, we read two integers:

x = buying price

y = selling price

We then compare the values:

If y > x, Chef makes a PROFIT

If y < x, Chef faces a LOSS

If x == y, it's a NEUTRAL outcome

These conditions are checked using three separate if statements.

For each test case, the appropriate result is printed on a new line.

This is a basic comparison-based problem that checks your understanding of conditional logic and standard I/O in C.

🧠 Time Complexity: O(t)
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
